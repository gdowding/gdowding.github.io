{"name":"Gdowding.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### Producing Music on a Linux Laptop.\r\nStarted looking for a laptop that I could install linux on a bit more seriously today. I'm looking at a Lenovo T430. My main questions are on which processor to buy. I am not looking to spend excessive amounts of money, so if I don't need to upgrade that is better.\r\n\r\nMy baseline is a Mac mini which I use NI Machine, and occasionally Ableton, Reaper or Renoise. Moving forward, I'd like to use open source software. I have some interest in the software side of digital music production. Maybe that is a distraction from actually making music. I'm also have a bit of outboard gear now, so I expect I'll be doing some more production OTB, but would like to have something to compliment the outboard gear as well as have something portable.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find out my min has a 2.7 Ghz Intel Core i7. It seems to get over worked fairly easily even when not producing music.\r\n\r\nI think for now I am going to go with the T430 and get linux installed. In the mean time, I need to understand what the bottlenecks are with the mini. \r\n\r\nOne area I've identified is that loading projects in Machine seems to take a while (couple of seconds). I suspect an SSD will make a significant improvement in this area.","google":"UA-43121397-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
