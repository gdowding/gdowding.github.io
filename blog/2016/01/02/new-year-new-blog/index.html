  <h1>New Year New Blog</h1>
  
<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1">Why blog with emacs, org and git?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
I mostly work with source code in emacs and git. When I take notes I
use org-mode. The times I've tried to blog in the past involved a lot
of overhead and context switching that overhead was one of the reasons
that prevented me from doing any blogging. There were other reasons,
like lack of ideas or fear of sharing lame posts, but it is a new
year, so I'm going to give it another try.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline3" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline3">Install org-page</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">
<p>
For an explanation on why I chose org-page, see <a href="#orgheadline2">Addendum Choices</a> below.
</p>

<p>
I use <a href="https://github.com/cask/cask">cask</a> to manage emacs packages when they are available. Otherwise, I
clone the repository and install manually. The <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page">org-page</a> github
repository also has instructions on using melpa or manual
installation. 
</p>

<p>
In ~/.emacs.d/Cask
</p>
<pre class="example">
(depends-on "org-page")
</pre>

<p>
Then run cask from the CLI. This will install org-page and all of its
dependencies.
</p>
<pre class="example">
cd ~/.emacs.d
cask
</pre>

<p>
Finally in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
</p>
<pre class="example">
(require 'org-page)
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline4">Initial setup</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline4">
<p>
I already had a site set up on github for blogging which has been
sitting idle which I have cloned locally <a href="https://gdowding.github.io/">https://gdowding.github.io/</a>. 
</p>

<p>
Org-page uses the master branch for generated files, and a source
branch for the org-mode source files. I find this way of using
branches a little strange, but I'm willing to work with it for now.
</p>

<p>
I had some files left over from my last blogging attempt, so I moved
them to a new branch then removed all files in master. Org-page needs
a source branch, so I created that as well.
</p>

<p>
Starting from a clean repository.
</p>
<pre class="example">
git branch source
git checkout source
</pre>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline5">Basic customization</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline5">
<p>
Here is the minimal configuration. There are a couple of default
values that include the developers link, so best to set these to
something.
</p>

<pre class="example">
;; Blog with org-page
(require 'org-page)
(setq op/repository-directory "~/git/gdowding/gdowding.github.io")
(setq op/site-domain "https://gdowding.github.io")
(setq op/personal-github-link "https://github.com/gdowding")
(setq op/site-main-title "Adrift")
(setq op/site-sub-title "")
(setq op/theme 'phaer)
</pre>

<p>
Once that is all done make sure you are in the source branch, run M-X
op/new-repository which will create an about.org file in root of the
repository. Edit that file and commit it. Then run M-X
op/do-publication-and-preview-site. You should see the site, click the
About link and make sure you are happy with the results.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline6" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline6">Usage</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline6">
<p>
Org-page takes org files from source branch and generates html files
in master branch. In addition there are special file locations and
headers that it uses to generated the site. The easiest way to work
with it is to use the provided helper functions. In addition, my
work-flow is to create a new branch for each blog post then merge to
source when I am mostly happy with it. The reason is that I typically
have multiple posts in progress, but want to work on them separately.
</p>

<p>
Here is my work-flow
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline7" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline7">Create a New Branch and Check It Out</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline7">
<pre class="example">
git branch new-post source
git checkout new-post
</pre>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgheadline8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline8">Create a New Post</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline8">
<pre class="example">
M-X op/new-post
</pre>

<p>
This will walk through the steps of creating a new file and putting
it in the correct place and adding a header. There is a keywords and
tags options. I'm not sure what the difference is. I put the same
values for both.
</p>

<p>
Since this post is not in the source branch it will not show up during
preview. So create file local variable while it is on the topic
branch.
</p>

<p>
With the new-post.org file open,
</p>
<pre class="example">
M-X add-file-local-variable
Add file-local variable: op/repository-org-branch
Add op/repository-org-branch with value: "new-post"
</pre>

<p>
This will create a commented section at the bottom of the file
containing this file-local variable. When
M-X op/do-publication-and-preview-site is called while editing a file on a
topic branch the branch specified in the file will be used as the org
source. If not specified, weird things will happen.
</p>

<pre class="example">
# Local Variables:
# op/repository-org-branch: new-post
# End:
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline9">Merge Blog Post to Source When Ready</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline9">
<pre class="example">
git checkout source
git merge new-post
</pre>

<p>
After merging, remove the file-local variable specifying the branch.
</p>

<p>
Either remove it manually or use the function:
</p>
<pre class="example">
M-X delete-file-local-variable
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline10" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline10">Generate Static Files</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline10">
<pre class="example">
M-X ob/do-publication
</pre>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline11" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline11">Push to Public Site</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgheadline11">
<pre class="example">
git push
</pre>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline12" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline12">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline12">
<p>
Org-page is a nice, simple to use, package that allows me to blog with
emacs and org-mode. In the coarse of a few hours I was able to get it
set up as I was writing this blog post. There are few things that I'd
like to change, such as, the style and having it show more of the blog
post on the main page, but this is a work-flow I can live
with.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline2">Addendum Choices</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
There are several choices listed
here. <a href="http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html">http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html</a>. I am was looking for
something simple to set up and start using that I could host on
<a href="http://gdowding.github.io/">http://gdowding.github.io/</a>. Org-mode has a build in project feature
that allows creating projects that can be converted to HTML
pages. I've tried that in the past and was never happy with the output
and didn't have time to attempt to customize it to what I wanted.
</p>

<p>
Based on the descriptions, I decided to give <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page">org-page</a> a try. It looked
like the simplest approach and the author's site looked, more or less,
like what I wanted. As I started working with it, I found it was using
Git and Emacs in a way that I could easily leverage for creating blog
posts.
</p>

<p>
A couple of other options that looked interesting are
<a href="http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode">http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg">https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg</a>. Nikola looks like it has many
more features that org-page. It is a static site generator with an
org-mode plugin. I may have a use for it in the future if I am making
a full web site. My main issues is that it looks like a more intensive
set up and I would have to use the CLI to create blog posts and
build. Lazyblog is interesting in that it attempts to make the effort
of blogging minimal. Just tag entries with with :blog: and they will
be converted to blog posts. It look like it is less mature than
org-page and I decided that I do want to have some level of process to
separate random notes from blog posts.
</p>

<p>
I might give one of the other approaches a try in the future, but for
now here is how I'm setting up and using org-page.
