This post is about using open source password management tools. I had
been using the Keychain App built into OS X, which was convenient and
worked when I had an iPhone, but since switching to an Android phone,
I had to find something that was not Apple exclusive. My first attempt
was to look for an Android app that also had a OS X
implementation. The app allowed me to sync my keys using Dropbox and
was working well until the trial period ended for the Android
app. After the trial period, synchronization stopped working which
made the product unusable for me. That prompted me to look for an open
source implementation that allowed me to have better control over my
passwords. What I found involves some more manual steps, but gives me
more control and doesn't store any data in the cloud.

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline2">
<p>
What I found was <a href="http://www.passwordstore.org">pass, the standard unix password manager</a>. Pass is a
shell script that organizes stores passwords using directory structure
for organization and <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/index.html">GNU privacy guard</a> to encrypt the data. Pass can
optionally configure the top level password directory as a git repository
that can then be used to synchronize between devices. There several
interfaces including an Android app and emacs integration.
</p>

<p>
Setting up on OS X was straight forward. I am using <a href="http://brew.sh">homebrew</a> for
package management, so that was a simple command <code>brew install pass</code>
which installed pass and its dependencies. For Linux VMs at work, I
had to install pass from the git repository, but supporting
dependencies were available from the system's package management system.
</p>

<p>
The Android setup took a little more work. It involved installing
<a href="https://github.com/zeapo/Android-Password-Store">Android-Password-Store</a> for password management and <a href="https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain">open-keychain</a> which
provides OpenPGP support. To get things working, I had to transfer the
pgp key to access the passwords, and an ssh key which could be used to
synchronize between my phone and main computer. Transferring the files to
Android and finding them took most of the time. Android-Password-Store
had decent instructions for setting things up, but leaves out some
details like how to unlock an encrypted pgp key.
</p>

<p>
Now that this is set up, I can synchronize my phone and work computer
manually using git. I had to create a bare repository that I could
push changes to and having a single point for synchronization. This is
mainly a command line solution.

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>My password data is not stored in the cloud (although that is an option).</li>
<li>I don't need a memorable/weak password to bootstrap my
keychain. Having a good password for iCloud was problematic when
trying to enter it on an an iPhone or iPad.</li>
<li>I can use pass in software that requires authentication, for example
I use scripts to manage JIRA issues and can use pass to allow
those scripts to have secure access to the required passwords (once
I have gpg session set up).</li>
