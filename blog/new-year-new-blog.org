#+DESCRIPTION: Getting started on blogging for the New Year with org-page
* Why blog with emacs, org and git?

I mostly work with source code in emacs and git. When I take notes I
use org-mode. The times I've tried to blog in the past involved a lot
of overhead and context switching that overhead was one of the reasons
that prevented me from doing any blogging. There were other reasons,
like lack of ideas or fear of sharing lame posts, but it is a new
year, so I'm going to give it another try. 

* Choices

There are several choices listed
here. http://orgmode.org/worg/org-blog-wiki.html. I am was looking for
something simple to set up and start using that I could host on
http://gdowding.github.io. Org-mode has a build in project feature
that allows creating projects that can be converted to HTML
pages. I've tried that in the past and was never happy with the output
and didn't have time to attempt to customize it to what I wanted.

Based on the descriptions, I decided to give [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] a try. It looked
like the simplest approach and the author's site looked, more or less,
like what I wanted. As I started working with it, I found it was using
Git and Emacs in a way that I could easily leverage for creating blog
posts.

A couple of other options that looked interesting are
http://plugins.getnikola.com/#orgmode and
https://github.com/novoid/lazyblorg. Nikola looks like it has many
more features that org-page. It is a static site generator with an
org-mode plugin. I may have a use for it in the future if I am making
a full web site. My main issues is that it looks like a more intensive
set up and I would have to use the CLI to create blog posts and
build. Lazyblog is interesting in that it attempts to make the effort
of blogging minimal. Just tag entries with with :blog: and they will
be converted to blog posts. It look like it is less mature than
org-page and I decided that I do want to have some level of process to
separate random notes from blog posts.

I might give one of the other approaches a try in the future, but for
now here is how I'm setting up and using org-page.

* Install org-page

I [[https://github.com/cask/cask][cask]] to manage emacs packages when they are available. Otherwise, I
clone the repository and install manually. The [[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]] github
repository also has instructions on using melpa or manual
installation. 

In ~/.emacs.d/Cask
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(depends-on "org-page")
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then run cask from the CLI. This will install org-page and all of its
dependencies.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
cd ~/.emacs.d
cask
#+END_EXAMPLE

Finally in ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
(require 'org-page)
#+END_EXAMPLE

* Initial setup

I already had a site set up on github for blogging which has been
sitting idle which I have cloned locally [[https://gdowding.github.io]]. 

Org-page uses the master branch for generated files, and a source
branch for the org-mode source files. I find this way of using
branches a little strange, but I'm willing to work with it for now.

I had some files left over from my last blogging attempt, so I moved
them to a new branch then removed all files in master. Org-page needs
a source branch, so I created that as well.

Starting from a clean repository.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git branch source
git checkout source
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Basic customization

Here is the minimal configuration. There are a couple of default
values that include the developers link, so best to set these to
something.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; Blog with org-page
(require 'org-page)
(setq op/repository-directory "~/git/gdowding/gdowding.github.io")
(setq op/site-domain "https://gdowding.github.io")
(setq op/personal-github-link "https://github.com/gdowding")
(setq op/site-main-title "Adrift")
(setq op/site-sub-title "")
(setq op/theme 'phaer)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once that is all done make sure you are in the source branch, run M-X
op/new-repository which will create an about.org file in root of the
repository. Edit that file and commit it. Then run M-X
op/do-publication-and-preview-site. You should see the site, click the
About link and make sure you are happy with the results.

* Usage

Org-page takes org files from source branch and generates html files
in master branch. In addition there are special file locations and
headers that it uses to generated the site. The easiest way to work
with it is to use the provided helper functions. In addition, my
work-flow is to create a new branch for each blog post then merge to
source when I am mostly happy with it. The reason is that I typically
have multiple posts in progress, but want to work on them separately.

Here is my work-flow

** Create a New Branch and Check It Out

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git branch new-post source
git checkout new-post
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Create a New Post
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
op/new-post
#+END_EXAMPLE

This will walk through the steps of creating a new file and putting
it in the correct place and adding a header.

** Merge Blog Post to Source When Ready

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git checkout source
git merge new-post
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Generate Static Files

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ob/do-publication
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Push to Public Site

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
git push
#+END_EXAMPLE
